Introduction 
RealTime StockStream is a high-performance, real-time stock market data processing 
system developed to efficiently monitor, analyze, and store large volumes of stock trade 
information. The system leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Apache Kafka for data 
ingestion, Apache Spark for real-time data processing, and Apache Cassandra for scalable 
storage. This report details the project’s architecture, key functionalities, development 
process, challenges faced, and potential future enhancements. 
Objectives 
The objective of the project is to create a pipeline capable of handling real-time stock market 
data streams. The key goals are: 
1. Collect and stream stock data from multiple sources. 
2. Process and analyze the data in real-time using advanced analytics techniques. 
3. Store the processed data efficiently in a scalable and fault-tolerant database. 
4. Provide real-time visualizations for monitoring stock trends, alongside alert systems 
for significant price movements. 
Technologies Used 
The choice of technologies is based on their proven capabilities to handle high-throughput, 
real-time data. The key technologies used are: 
 Apache Kafka: A distributed event streaming platform to handle the real-time 
ingestion of stock data. 
 Apache Spark: A powerful analytics engine used to process large-scale data in real 
time. 
 Apache Cassandra: A distributed NoSQL database chosen for its ability to store 
time-series data and handle high read/write throughput. 
 Plotly Dash: A web-based framework used for creating interactive visualizations and 
dashboards to track stock performance. 
System Architecture 
The RealTime StockStream system architecture integrates several technologies into a 
cohesive pipeline that processes data in real time and provides users with interactive insights. 
The architecture can be broken down into the following key components: 
1. Kafka as the Event Streaming Platform: Kafka acts as the backbone of the system 
by streaming live stock data into a stocks topic. The Kafka producers fetch real-time 
stock data and push it to the Kafka brokers, ensuring that the system receives a 
constant stream of fresh stock data. 
2. Spark for Real-Time Processing: Apache Spark consumes the data from Kafka and 
applies various analytics operations such as moving averages, grouping aggregations, 
and detecting price changes. Spark’s distributed architecture allows it to process large 
volumes of data in near real time, making it an ideal choice for financial applications. 
3. Cassandra for Data Storage: Spark stores processed data into Cassandra, which 
provides a highly available and partitioned data store. The keyspace stockdata 
includes tables that track each stock’s trade details such as price, quantity, and time of 
the trade. 
4. Plotly Dash for Visualization: The system generates real-time visualizations using 
Plotly Dash, presenting stock price trends, moving averages, and significant events. 
These interactive charts help traders and analysts monitor the market efficiently. 
5. Docker for Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose simplify the 
management of Kafka, Zookeeper, Cassandra, and Spark by encapsulating them in 
containerized environments, making the entire system portable and easy to deploy. 
Development Process 
1. Kafka Setup 
Apache Kafka was configured locally using Docker Compose. The first step was to set up a 
Kafka topic named stocks: 
bash 
Copy code 
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic stocks --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 -
replication-factor 1 
Kafka enables reliable, high-throughput streaming by managing distributed logs of stock 
price data. The producer script was developed in Python, using libraries such as confluent
kafka to stream real-time stock prices to the Kafka broker every few seconds. 
2. Cassandra Schema 
The Cassandra schema was designed to handle time-series data for stock trades efficiently: 
Sql Code 
CREATE KEYSPACE stockdata WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 
'replication_factor' : 1}; 
CREATE TABLE stockdata.stocks ( 
stock text, 
trade_id uuid, 
price decimal, 
quantity int, 
trade_type text, 
trade_date date, 
trade_time time, 
PRIMARY KEY (stock, trade_id) 
); 
Cassandra’s partitioned architecture ensures that high-volume data ingestion can occur 
without performance bottlenecks. This table stores the raw trade data and allows queries 
based on stock symbols, dates, and trade IDs. 
3. Spark for Data Processing 
Spark was configured to consume messages from the Kafka stocks topic and apply various 
analytics operations. A key Spark job was to calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA), 
which helps analysts identify stock price trends over time: 
Python code 
windowedStockData = stockStreamData \ 
.groupBy("stock") \ 
.agg(mean("price").alias("sma")) 
The real-time aggregation of data was complemented by additional analytics functions such 
as ranking, pivot aggregation, and rolling aggregations. These functions provided meaningful 
insights into the stock market’s performance over various time windows. 
4. Data Visualization 
The final component of the system was the Plotly Dash dashboard, which provided real-time 
visualizations for the stock data. Dash integrates seamlessly with Python and was used to plot 
interactive graphs of stock prices, SMAs, and significant events such as price increases or 
decreases of 5%. The user-friendly interface enables analysts to zoom in on specific time 
periods and track changes in stock prices visually. 
Bash code 
$ python3 dashboard.py 
The dashboard displays key visual elements: 
 Real-time stock price movements. 
 SMA lines over 5-period and 10-period windows. 
 Price alerts whenever a stock crosses a threshold of 5% movement. 
Challenges Faced 
During the development of RealTime StockStream, several challenges were encountered and 
addressed: 
1. Handling Real-Time Data: Kafka’s configuration had to be optimized to manage 
high-throughput streams efficiently. Tuning the consumer’s settings, such as 
fetch.min.bytes and linger.ms, was necessary to balance latency and throughput. 
2. Managing Data Storage: Cassandra’s schema design had to be optimized for time
series data to avoid bottlenecks. Partitioning strategies were refined to distribute data 
evenly across the cluster and avoid hotspots. 
3. Integration of Spark and Kafka: Ensuring Spark jobs consumed data from Kafka 
and wrote to Cassandra efficiently required careful orchestration. Fault tolerance was 
achieved through the use of checkpointing, ensuring Spark could recover from 
failures without data loss. 
4. Scalability and Containerization: Docker Compose simplified managing multiple 
services but required fine-tuning to ensure all services started and communicated 
correctly. Containers were optimized for resource usage to ensure high performance 
under heavy loads. 
Results and Insights 
The RealTime StockStream system successfully achieved the objectives of real-time data 
ingestion, processing, and visualization. The use of Kafka, Spark, and Cassandra provided a 
scalable, fault-tolerant solution capable of handling the rapid ingestion and analysis of stock 
data. 
Key insights include: 
 Scalability: The system is horizontally scalable due to the nature of Kafka and 
Cassandra. This means more stock data sources can be added without affecting 
performance. 
 Low Latency: Spark’s streaming capabilities ensured that insights such as moving 
averages and price alerts were available with minimal latency, providing real-time 
information to traders. 
 Customization: The Plotly Dash dashboard can be easily customized to add more 
visualizations or integrate additional analytics functions, providing flexibility for end
users. 
Future Enhancements 
There are several potential improvements that could be made to RealTime StockStream: 
1. Predictive Analytics: Implementing machine learning models to predict future stock 
prices or trends based on historical data. 
2. Alert System Customization: Allow users to define custom thresholds for alerts 
based on price movements or volume. 
3. Enhanced Security: Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit to ensure the 
privacy of stock trade information. 
4. Cloud Deployment: Moving the system to a cloud platform such as AWS or GCP to 
leverage their managed Kafka and Cassandra services, ensuring greater scalability and 
reliability. 
Conclusion 
RealTime StockStream provides a comprehensive solution for real-time stock data 
processing and analysis, offering scalability, low-latency processing, and interactive 
visualizations. By leveraging modern distributed technologies, the system can efficiently 
handle large volumes of stock trade data, making it a valuable tool for financial institutions 
and individual traders alike.
